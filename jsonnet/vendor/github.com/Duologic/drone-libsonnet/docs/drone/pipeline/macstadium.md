## Fields

### fn new

```ts
new(name)
```

`new` is a shorthand for creating a new pipeline object

### fn withClone

```ts
withClone(value)
```



### fn withCloneMixin

```ts
withCloneMixin(value)
```



### fn withDependsOn

```ts
withDependsOn(value)
```



### fn withDependsOnMixin

```ts
withDependsOnMixin(value)
```



### fn withKind

```ts
withKind(value)
```



### fn withName

```ts
withName(value)
```



### fn withParallelStepsMixin

```ts
withParallelStepsMixin(steps, dependsOn=["clone"])
```

Pipeline steps are executed sequentially by default. You can optionally
describe your build steps as a directed acyclic graph with `depends_on`.

'`withParallelStepsMixin` will configure each step with `<dependsOn>` to
ensure these steps are executed in parallel. By default it will set
`depends_on` to 'clone'.


### fn withPlatform

```ts
withPlatform(value)
```



### fn withPlatformMixin

```ts
withPlatformMixin(value)
```



### fn withSteps

```ts
withSteps(value)
```



### fn withStepsMixin

```ts
withStepsMixin(value)
```



### fn withTrigger

```ts
withTrigger(value)
```



### fn withTriggerMixin

```ts

```



### obj clone


#### fn clone.withDepth

```ts
withDepth(value)
```



#### fn clone.withDisable

```ts
withDisable()
```

`withDisable` is a shorthand for disabling cloning, it will also unset
`clone.depth` and `clone.retries` to avoid confusion


#### fn clone.withRetries

```ts
withRetries(value)
```



### obj platform


#### fn platform.withArch

```ts
withArch(value)
```



#### fn platform.withOs

```ts
withOs(value)

### obj trigger


#### fn trigger.hourly

```ts
hourly()
```

`hourly` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `hourly` `cron` event.


#### fn trigger.nightly

```ts
nightly()
```

`hourly` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `nightly` `cron` event.


#### fn trigger.onCronSchedule

```ts
onCronSchedule()
```

`onCronSchedule` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `cron` event with `<schedule>`


#### fn trigger.onModifiedPath

```ts
onModifiedPath()
```

`onModifiedPath` shorthand for `onModifiedPaths([path])

#### fn trigger.onModifiedPaths

```ts
onModifiedPaths()
```

`onModifiedPaths` will conditionally limit pipeline execution on changes
to these paths (requires plugin)


#### fn trigger.onPromotion

```ts
onPromotion()
```

`onPromotion` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `promotion` event


#### fn trigger.onPullRequest

```ts
onPullRequest()
```

`onPullRequest` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `pull_request` event


#### fn trigger.onPullRequestAndPushToBranches

```ts
onPullRequestAndPushToBranches()
```

`onPullRequestAndPushToBranches` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to `push` and `pull_request` events on `<branches>`


#### fn trigger.onPushToBranches

```ts
onPushToBranches()
```

`onPushToBranches` will conditionally limit pipeline execution to
a `push` event on `<branches>`


#### fn trigger.onPushToMainBranch

```ts
onPushToMainBranch()
```

`onPushToMainBranch` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `push` event on `main` branch


#### fn trigger.onPushToMasterBranch

```ts
onPushToMasterBranch()
```

`onPushToMasterBranch` will conditionally limit pipeline
execution to a `push` event on `master` branch
